# TODO: Fix GitHub Actions Deployment Error

## Completed Steps
- [x] Analyze the GitHub Actions workflow and identify the cause of "sudo: docker: command not found" error
- [x] Read relevant files (.github/workflows/main.yml, docker-compose.production.yml)
- [x] Create a plan to remove 'sudo' from docker commands in the workflow script
- [x] Edit .github/workflows/main.yml to remove 'sudo' from docker compose commands

## Pending Steps
- [ ] Commit and push the changes to the repository to test the updated workflow
- [ ] Verify that the remote host has Docker installed
- [ ] Ensure the SSH user on the remote host is added to the docker group (run `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` on remote host if needed)
- [ ] Test the deployment by triggering the workflow (e.g., push to main branch)
- [ ] Monitor the workflow logs to confirm the deployment succeeds without the docker command error
