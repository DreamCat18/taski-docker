# Taski Project Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Model Typo
- **File**: `backend/api/models.py`

- **Fix**: Corrected the method name
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 2. CORS Configuration
- **File**: `backend/backend/settings.py`

- **Fix**: Added multiple origins including Docker service names and enabled `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS`
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 3. Frontend API Base URL
- **File**: `frontend/src/App.js`
- **Issue**: Axios requests didn't have proper base URL for Docker environment
- **Fix**: Added `axios.defaults.baseURL` configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 4. Docker Compose Configuration
- **File**: `docker-compose.yml`
- **Issue**: Frontend service wasn't running development server
- **Fix**: Updated frontend service to run `npm start` and expose port 3000
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 5. Nginx Gateway Configuration
- **File**: `gateway/nginx.conf`
- **Issue**: Gateway wasn't properly proxying requests to frontend
- **Fix**: Updated root location to proxy to frontend service
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Setup**:
   - Run `docker-compose up` to start all services
   - Verify frontend can communicate with backend
   - Check API endpoints are working

2. **Verify Database**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running and migrations are applied
   - Check if tasks can be created, read, updated, and deleted

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Ensure React app is running on port 3000
   - Verify API calls are working through the gateway

4. **Production Deployment**:
   - Test with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up`
   - Ensure all services work in production mode
